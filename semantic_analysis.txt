# Decision:
# 1. Trivial function parameters (int, bool, float, etc) are by value
# 2. Structs function parameters are also passed by value
#   - string and array struct members are passed by value as etl::string and etl::array
# 3. Non-trivial function parameters are always by reference
#   - arrays are passed as span
#   - strings are passed as string_view
# 4. Function returns are by default by value
#   - For strings and arrays and structs, this could result in a large object on the stack and an additional copy of data.
#     However, returning things by reference means that the returned values must exist outside the scope of the function.
#     This is more efficient, but less intuitive
#   - At a later stage it may become possible to annotate a function to make it return something by reference
# 5. The implication of returning things by value is that it is not possible to return an auto string
# 6. The implication of passing structs by value is that it structs cannot have an auto string member


- return auto string: possible, but returned string must not be a temporary
- return optional auto string: possible, but returned string must not be a temporary
- return array of auto string: possible but returned strings must not be temporaries
- return struct with auto string member: possible, but string member must not be a temporary

- auto string parameter: possible, but string must be consumed in called function, string_view must not be stored
- optional auto string parameter: possible, but string must be consumed in called function, string_view must not be stored
- array of auto string parameter: possible, but strings must be consumed in called function, string_view must not be stored
- struct with auto string member: possible, but strings must be consumed in called function, string_view must not be stored
