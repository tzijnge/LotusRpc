# LotusRPC ðŸŒ¼
> **_WARNING:_**  This project is work in progress

LotusRPC is an RPC framework for embedded systems based on [ETL](https://github.com/ETLCPP/etl). It generates C++ code with no dynamic memory allocations, no exceptions, no RTTI, etc. Code generator and client side CLI application in a simple Python package.

## Installation
Install from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/lotusrpc/) with ```pip install lotusrpc```

## Basic usage
Installing the Python package installs the `lrpcg` tool on your system. This is the LotusRPC generator. It also installs the `lrpcc` tool on your system. This is the LotusRpc CLI client.

Your RPC interface is specified in a YAML file

File name: _example.lrpc.yaml_
``` yaml
services:
  - name: "battery"
    functions:
      - name: "get"
        params:
          - name: "option"
            type: "@VoltageScales"
        returns:
          - name: "voltage"
            type: double
enums:
  - name: "VoltageScales"
    fields:
        name: "microvolts"
        name: "millivolts"
        name: "volts"
```

Generate server side code by simply running this command

```lrpcg example.lrpc.yaml -o output-dir```

Give the generated code a meaningful implementation and hook it up to a transport layer. Flash your embedded device. Then use `lrpcc` to communicate with your device and print the result to the console

```lrpcc battery get microvolts```
