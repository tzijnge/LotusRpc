# STM32
An example LRPC server is available for the STM32 Nucleo L496 board [here](https://github.com/tzijnge/LotusRpc/tree/main/examples/stm32_nucleo_l496). It shows a very basic LRPC definition file in _App/lrpc_, how to integrate the LRPC code generation tool in CMake and how to use the generated code in an embedded environment with C++.

For more information see [readme.md](https://github.com/tzijnge/LotusRpc/tree/main/examples/stm32_nucleo_l496/readme.md).
